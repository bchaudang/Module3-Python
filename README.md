# Module-3-Python
Python Challenge Assignment

This challenge was easier to navigate than the previous assignment, VBA in excel. I found that Visual Studio/Python much more user friendly.
I ran into a few issues at the beginning of the assignment, I attempted to use the code we had learned in class for creating the csv path, however an error kept appearing that there was no file/directory found. I used askBCS, which was extremely helpful, and a learning assistant helped me through it by using pathlib. 
I was also have some issues with creating a text file that would output the results of both, but then I utilized askBCS again. The online tutor session I had, also helped me with an issue that I was having where the rows of data were being skipped, and much like VBA in excel, variables and rows need to be reset when skipping the header. I was having a few issues with pushing my files onto GitHub, but I was able to finally recreate another repository and push the files on for submission.
